# Display Filter validation — 20 September 2026

Hardware: RTX 5090, NVIDIA driver 616.64, Windows 11. Original NVIDIA-signed NR 310.8 runtime. Ordinary driver feature creation and evaluation succeeded using this application's own project identity. No compatibility loader, DLL patching, game injection or game process-memory access was used.

## Feature/control parity update

The capture-compatible NR controls now include up to ten separately configured passes, style/preset/auto mask, 25�200% working resolution with the eight in-game spatial filters, highlight guard, hold/hide edit, full comparison controls/labels and debug views. Controls are grouped into tabs. See `PARITY.md` for scope and the small UI differences.

Headless GPU checks with the D3D12 debug layer passed the new settings round trip (temporary INI), independent ten-pass transitions and pass-10 edits, inactive profile isolation, held-frame identity while source/model size changes, hidden edit/live resume, all spatial filters, 200% scaling, supersampled HDR/three-pass motion and hold-release reset, highlight guard, debug views, exact wipe regions, side-by-side zoom and label sizes. Existing two-pass private-DLSS/motion/appearance checks passed, including exact SDR/HDR bypass and finite HDR highlights. The actual OptiScaler wrapper and standalone retained bit-identical model/compose results on the existing matched-input fixture, including 12 retained-history frames.

Logs: `out-parity/features.log`, `out-parity/private-regression.log`, `out-parity/default-parity.log`. These are correctness checks while the PC is in use, not controlled performance measurements. The new UI was built and statically inspected; no desktop/game was operated or launched. Live visual and game verification is left to the user. This feature update does not claim to fix the previously reported live image-quality gap.

## Monitor mode update

Added screen selection, monitor geometry, capture exclusion for the monitor overlay, and pause/resume while using Display Filter's controls. A live monitor run processed 4K frames, and the monitor fixture confirmed changed NR pixels and exact zero-strength output. The full monitor check remains inconclusive: an initial screen/window comparison exceeded its tolerance, and the latest run stopped when foreground focus differed from the expected fixture window. These results do not establish feedback prevention or a complete focus-switching pass. Further live testing is left to the user as requested.

## Focus crash and estimated motion update

The reported Windows crash record identified an execute access violation in `_nvngx.dll_unloaded`. The dispatcher is now pinned until process exit, including failed initialization paths, while model/GPU resources still shut down normally. This addresses the recorded unloaded-code failure; the original exception was not reproduced live under the debugger.

- Five consecutive NGX initialize/shutdown cycles passed, with the dispatcher remaining resident.
- Window capture of an already-running Raid: Shadow Legends session ran for several minutes in zero-motion mode, including focus loss/resume and normal stop/close, without another observed crash. No game was launched. This establishes operation during that session, not comprehensive image-quality verification.
- New optional GPU motion estimation passed a known (+12, -8) pixel translation fixture: current-to-previous vectors had 0.000-pixel median error, with 97.1% of sampled vectors within 2.5 pixels. Finite-vector, static-frame, first-frame, explicit-reset and scene-cut checks passed.
- The motion-enabled NR path at 1440p produced changed pixels, exact SDR/HDR zero-strength identity, finite HDR output and retained highlights. It measured 6.04 ms mean / 6.69 ms p95 with 906 MiB application VRAM on a static image over 30 frames.

Estimated motion defaults off. It uses GPU luminance pyramids and patch matching, retains NR history during continuous captures, and resets on discontinuities. Depth is still constant; motion quality and performance in live gameplay remain unverified.

## Motion enable follow-up

The reported persistent disappearance of the effect was not reproduced in independent fixtures. Source tracing and measurement did establish a first-enable stall: runtime compilation of the three optical-flow shaders took 3,211.7 ms in the initialization check. Compiling those shaders during the build reduced the same check to 8.1 ms, retaining the same 97.1% translation accuracy. The application also now replaces stale running statistics with explicit pause/resume messages when its output is hidden; pause time is excluded from resumed FPS statistics.

Before this fix, the independent moving-window check already passed 90 frames at 1916×1146, including changed pixels after the first frame and exact comparison of the presented output. The headless model check now also uses a shared capture-like texture, moves the entire image, switches between zero and estimated motion, and requires changed pixels throughout the sequence and consecutive HDR evaluations. This distinguishes successful model processing from the user's still-unconfirmed live presentation symptom. No further desktop interaction or game testing was performed after the user requested headless work only.

The final 4K headless run passed those checks, including exact SDR/HDR zero-strength identity. Motion-enabled processing measured 10.83 ms mean / 11.56 ms p95 over 10 timed frames, with 1,573 MiB application VRAM. This is processing time on the fixture, not live application throughput or end-to-end latency.

## Verified

### FPS cap and NR loader update

Removed the application's Authenticode precheck for `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` and its corresponding packaging gate. The ordinary NGX driver loader remains responsible for initialization and compatibility errors. The build records the actually loaded NR module, rather than identifying only the requested file.

Added a persisted 0–360 processing FPS limit (0 uncapped), an interruptible high-resolution pacing timer, and `Present(0)` in place of refresh-synchronized `Present(1)`. While capped, captures are drained and their GPU-copy waits completed, retaining only the latest input for processing. Stop/capture events interrupt pacing, and visibility/settings are rechecked at most 20 ms later. The source/GPU and compositor refresh still constrain observed frame rates. Private DLSS receives measured capture intervals.

Headless timer checks passed caps of 30, 120 and 240 FPS (29.7, 116.7 and 219.9 measured scheduling FPS on this run), plus uncapped behavior, capture-event wakeup without bypassing the cap, and stop interruption. These are timer-only measurements, not live WGC or presentation throughput. No desktop interaction or game launch was performed.

The matched-settings static history check processed 60 frames, with exactly one reset. Mean edit was 0.0151868 for reset mode versus 0.0155371 with retained history, and their output difference was 0.0031046. This does not explain the user's reported settings-parity quality/strength gap. Logs: `out/parity-history.log`. The settings/default changes from the previous audit must not be presented as a demonstrated fix for that gap.

### Model application alignment audit

See `ALIGNMENT.md` for the source comparison and its limits. Corrected first-pass Local tone default (1), later-pass Local tone (0), separate NR parameter maps, model control ranges (0–2), separate final Detail strength (0–2), all five HDR mapping choices, and finished-SDR input/output conversion. The shared in-game shader and game builds remain unchanged. Existing preferences are preserved except model values over 2 are clamped on load; the running app's settings file was not edited during development.

GPU readback confirmed that the SDR model input matches original sRGB within FP16 precision. SDR-on-HDR white normalization differed by at most 0.000000045 between equivalent 80/320-nit fixtures. Exact disabled/zero-strength output, alpha, full skin/environment protection, one/two passes, colour endpoints, private DLSS switching, moving frames and both HDR codecs passed. Tests used saved files and synthetic colour patches, without GUI interaction or game launch. The new content selector, live strength and reported eye artefacts still need user verification.

Replaying the old defaults reproduced mean RGB edit 0.007578 on the 720p wallpaper fixture; aligned defaults produced 0.012894. At fixed Local tone 1, removing the extra proxy curve did not increase mean edit magnitude; see the audit for that distinction. Logs: `out/alignment-old-defaults.log`, `out/alignment-sdr.log`, `out/alignment-dlss-multipass.log`. The 1440p/50%/two-pass/private-DLSS/motion run measured 7.70 ms mean / 8.21 ms p95 and 1,164 MiB application VRAM over eight timed frames. Measurements are processing-only, not live FPS/latency guarantees.

### Private DLSS residual enlargement

The standalone runtime now owns a separate DLSS Super Resolution feature and parameter map under the existing NGX initialization. The unchanged shared shader encodes the difference between the original low-resolution proxy and the final NR answer into its signed carrier (mode 9), then decodes the enlarged carrier during matched-residual composition (transfer 2). Unit exposure, constant depth, model-resolution zero/estimated motion and zero jitter are supplied. Colour and skin controls are still applied once, after enlargement. All allocation, mode switching and release wait for the app's GPU fence.

Headless checks passed using NVIDIA-signed DLSS SR 310.1.0.0, SHA-256 `AD3E9C07EE864E9702032459A59C6825166766C2CB75BD0318D5626595693BDB`. They covered actual finite changed pixels, distinct DLSS versus Bilinear output, DLSS → Bilinear → DLSS switching, native-size bypass, one/two NR passes, estimated motion across moving frames, exact zero-strength SDR/HDR output, highlight preservation and the appearance controls. The tests included 1280×720 at 50%, 3840×2160 at 50% with two passes/motion, and 2561×1441 at 25% (640×360 model). D3D12 debug validation was requested; no reported errors failed these checks.

Identical-input DLSS evaluations with Reset asserted showed approximately 0.00017–0.00020 mean linear RGB variation on the fixtures. Recreating features to compare the same feature age restored exact normalized brightness invariance and exact appearance-control endpoints; the test tolerance was not loosened. The live path does not recreate a feature every frame. This is a temporal-quality limitation to inspect visually, not evidence of an HDR normalization regression. Synthetic depth/motion and absence of source jitter are not equivalent to engine-supplied DLSS guides.

The 4K/two-pass/50%/motion run measured 9.97 ms mean / 10.38 ms p95 over 12 timed frames, using 1,835 MiB application VRAM. These are short processing-only measurements on a shared GPU, not a live FPS or latency guarantee. Logs: `out/private-dlss-colour.log`, `out/private-dlss-4k.log`, `out/private-dlss-minimum.log`. No GUI interaction, live capture, game launch, game installation change or upstream source modification was performed.

### Separate colour and skin controls

Added the shared shader's independent model-colour strength (0–4), the runtime's skin-structure control (-1–2), and optional skin/environment detail and colour attenuation (0–1), including the colour-based mask preview. Existing defaults are preserved. Final composition runs once after either one or two model passes; these controls reuse the unchanged OptiScaler shader and model parameter helper.

Headless appearance checks passed at native 1280×720 with one pass and at 2560×1440 with a 50% model scale and two passes. Colour strengths 0, 1 and 4 produced different finite results. Enabling separation with all strengths at 1 preserved the previous output exactly. All strengths at 0 preserved the original pixels exactly, including HDR tests with both tone curves. Synthetic warm/blue patches verified mask selection and exact independent protection of skin-coloured versus environment regions. The runtime accepted skin structure 2; these fixtures do not establish the visual quality of that parameter on faces.

The reduced-resolution run also passed resolution/pass switching, white-level invariance, moving frames with estimated motion and HDR highlight preservation. Checks requested the D3D12 debug layer. Logs are `out/appearance-native.log` and `out/appearance-reduced.log`. No GUI interaction, live capture, game launch or existing installation changes were performed. The expanded controls remain for user verification.

### White slider, model resolution and matched residuals

The standalone controls now include an adjustable reference-white slider (0 means desktop; exact numeric entry remains), a 25–100% model-resolution slider, classic/matched-residual selection and the current bilinear enlargement option. The shared in-game colour shader remains unchanged. The native-size path retains its original arithmetic; below native size, both the unchanged model input and final answer are sampled with the same linear sampler before the shared matched-residual composition.

Headless checks passed with 1281×721 capture at 37% (474×267 model), two passes and motion enabled, including a run requesting the D3D12 debug layer. They verified finite pixels and preserved alpha, exact disabled/zero-strength SDR/HDR output, distinct classic/matched output at reduced resolution, identical transfer-mode output at native size, and exact reset-frame output after reduced → native → reduced switching. Motion remained active across a moving sequence; both HDR codecs retained highlights. White-level invariance and explicit reference overrides still passed.

A 4K capture at 50% (1920×1080 model), two passes and estimated motion passed the same checks. Over 12 timed frames, processing measured 15.08 ms mean / 19.72 ms p95 and 1,281 MiB application VRAM. These are short headless measurements on a shared GPU, not a guaranteed live 60 FPS result or end-to-end latency. Both model passes use the selected working size; estimated motion is calculated in that same pixel grid.

No GUI interaction, desktop capture or game launch was used for this update. The new controls and live visual quality still require user testing. Checks used the existing Windows wallpaper file, not a screenshot of the user's desktop.

### Desktop white reference and two-pass update

Read-only display metadata reported 140-nit SDR white on the primary HDR display. Previously, the standalone processor always assumed 203 nits for HDR displays. For SDR desktop images this divided the model's linear input by 203/140 (about 1.45), making it approximately 31% darker than the correctly normalized input before the proxy curve. The application now reads Windows' SDR white level for the selected display, with an explicit reference override for native HDR content. Windows settings are not changed.

The Hybrid menu item also incorrectly passed mode 0 (soft knee) to the shared shader. It now selects mode 3 (Hybrid composed); Neutwo continues to use mode 1. No in-game shaders or source files were modified.

The headless white-level regression uses the same image at 80 and 320 nits. Correct normalization produced zero mean RGB error after dividing out the physical brightness difference for both codecs. Holding the old 203-nit assumption instead produced measurable differences (0.0038590 Hybrid / 0.0036923 Neutwo at 720p). Explicit reference-white overrides also matched the corresponding automatic reference exactly.

Two-pass processing creates independent NR feature histories under one NGX runtime. The first result is clamped to the existing proxy range before the second evaluation; the final edit is resolved once against the original frame. A 2 -> 1 -> 2 pass switch passed, and the second pass produced a measurable additional change. At 1440p with estimated motion, processing measured 9.71 ms mean / 10.29 ms p95 and 1,432 MiB application VRAM. Zero-strength SDR/HDR identity, moving frames, finite HDR output and retained highlights passed. These are headless processing measurements, not live capture or game FPS. No desktop interaction or game launch was used for this update.

The final 4K two-pass run with estimated motion passed the same checks. Processing measured 19.98 ms mean / 21.07 ms p95 over 12 timed frames, with 2,569 MiB application VRAM. This workload exceeded the 16.67 ms processing budget for 60 FPS; the extra pass is optional and the default remains one pass.

### Earlier checks

- Release x64 builds both the application and independent check executable.
- Actual finite, changed output pixels from NR, including an existing recorded KCD2 frame. This used a saved file; KCD2 was not launched.
- Exact FP16 zero-strength identity for SDR and HDR, including highlights above SDR white.
- Hybrid and Neutwo HDR output remains finite and retains highlights above 1.0 scRGB.
- Windows Graphics Capture → shared GPU texture → NR → DirectComposition works in the check executable's moving/text test window.
- A second WGC session captures the presented output and compares it against the NR output texture. The tested 720p, 1440p and 4K frames matched exactly, ruling out a visible-but-empty output window.
- The underlying test window keeps focus, and `WindowFromPoint` resolves through the output to that window. No input synthesis or forwarding is used.
- Decorated-window client cropping, resize to 640×360, capture stop/restart, minimize/restore, and focus-loss hiding pass.
- Packaged control-window startup, automatic local-runtime selection, appearance-setting persistence, stop-message handling and clean close pass. This UI check did not start capture.
- Historical prototype signature-gate checks no longer apply: the selected NR DLL signature gate was subsequently removed. Driver loading/compatibility errors remain explicit.

## Measurements

These are short standalone measurements, not application benchmarks. The selected application will compete with NR for GPU resources.

| Workload | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1440p model + colour processing, serial GPU completion | 4.33 ms mean; 4.65 ms p95; 883 MiB application VRAM |
| 4K model + colour processing, serial GPU completion | 8.45 ms mean; 9.75 ms p95; 1,522 MiB application VRAM |
| 4K full capture/display, 180 frames | 59.9 steady processed FPS; 1,852 MiB application VRAM |
| 1440p full capture/display, 180 frames | 60.0 steady processed FPS; 1,014 MiB application VRAM |
| 4K acquisition → GPU completion | 8.0 ms p95 |
| 4K acquisition → `Present` return | 0.9 ms mean; 1.3 ms p95 |

The small `Present` return measurement is CPU submission timing: it does **not** include completion of the GPU work, all capture delay, DWM display scheduling, or physical scanout. It must not be advertised as end-to-end added latency. Full-pipeline throughput was approximately the test desktop's 60 Hz cadence.

A subsequent 4K processing run measured 7.96 ms mean / 8.39 ms p95, with the same 1,522 MiB footprint. The table retains the earlier measurement rather than selecting the faster run.

## Remaining verification

No games were launched. Beyond the limited already-running Raid session described above, compatibility with individual applications, text/control readability, motion quality and input feel need verification. Game anti-cheat acceptance is unverified. Constant depth with either zero or estimated motion is an experimental capture-based route, not equivalent to native temporal guides.

Actual HDR content on a physical HDR display, mixed-DPI/multi-monitor moves, hour-long operation, device-removal recovery, and physical input-to-display latency still need validation. Numeric HDR tests and successful scRGB presentation do not establish those results.

The normal OptiScaler release DLL remains unchanged at SHA-256 `36E6162226092A04402597CF5E7114C1DBCAADA7798926C0CDDE43F836554924`. No existing tracked source files, game installations, or upstream pull requests were modified.

Screen-border update: monitor sessions request Windows borderless-capture access before starting. Window sessions are unchanged. Build verified; no live capture or permission dialog was exercised during this update because the desktop is in use.

FPS counter: shader and application compiled; no live desktop/UI verification performed. Counter uses fresh processed captures, resets on pause, and is composited after NR at 50% opacity. Headless model checks omit it by default.

GPU fence-wait fix: replaced the stop-event-only 2 ms polling delay with a completion-fence event plus stop/message wakeups. Headless D3D12-debug-layer check passed: a controlled 3 ms completion delay woke in 3.31 ms on average across 20 iterations; stop cancellation, subsequent queue submissions, and Drain passed. FPS-cap tests also passed. Actual game/capture throughput remains for user verification.

## Capture cadence investigation
The previous application never set WGC MinUpdateInterval. On Windows versions exposing that property, capture now requests 1 ms before StartCapture; the application's selected FPS cap is unchanged. The previous and accepted intervals are logged. This addresses a reported WGC low-cadence behaviour for default/sub-millisecond intervals, but live confirmation is still required.

A headless `--performance-check 1` mode measures display queries and processing both with and without FPS labels. On this machine, the 1440p run measured display queries around 0.004 ms and white-point queries around 0.005 ms. With motion enabled, a subsequent timestamped test measured ~13.5 ms from CPU recording through completion and ~10.7 ms GPU timestamp span. These tests ran alongside the user's existing desktop workload; timings are not isolated benchmarks or proof of the live bottleneck. They do not include WGC or presentation. Motion on/off made no difference to the user's observed ~40 FPS ceiling.

Every existing two-second status report now has a separate Pipeline log entry: acquired pool-frame rate and average CPU elapsed time spent acquiring, waiting for captures, FPS pacing, waiting for GPU completion, recording/preparing, and Present. Record/prepare includes the scene-cut readback wait when motion estimation is enabled. Acquired frames include superseded frames dequeued from the capture pool, not unseen frames dropped by Windows.

Release application/checker build passed. No live capture, foreground changes or games were launched. Keep the previous fence-fix package for comparison.

## Independent capture producer and selectable DXGI backend

Release builds the application and checker. Headless `--capture-queue-check 1` passed with the D3D12 debug layer: FP16 HDR highlights above SDR white, SDR-to-linear conversion, all four display rotations, window-style crop, concurrent producer/consumer operation, protection of the pinned processing surface, newest-only selection, changing dimensions, and backend-setting persistence. Tests use synthetic application-owned textures; they do not start WGC/DXGI desktop capture or create windows. Frame-pacing and cancellation checks also pass (3.29 ms average for a controlled 3 ms completion signal).

The queue's producer waits on its explicit shared GPU copy fence before releasing a source frame and publishing the owned texture. The consumer only changes its pinned slot after processing GPU completion. At most three output surfaces and one reusable conversion input are retained. A capture-copy timeout retains unresolved ownership instead of releasing potentially live GPU resources. DXGI access loss ends capture and reveals the original display; restart is explicit.

Live 1440p/4K throughput, WGC-versus-DXGI comparison, self-capture exclusion, cursor handling, window focus and visible HDR output were NOT exercised: the user is using the PC and requested headless work. Desktop screenshots and games were not captured or launched. The new backend is for user verification, not a claim of 120 FPS.

## External DLSS Frame Generation

See FRAMEGEN.md for the new app-local focus adapter, headless interpolation results, driver-override limitation, and remaining live validation. This optional mode adds a separate HWND SDR/HDR10 presentation path; historical scRGB checks above describe FG-off operation.


## Capture/processing throughput audit — 21 September 2026

The live log at 09:30:33 showed DXGI acquiring/publishing 116.5 FPS while processing 45.3 FPS. Waiting for capture was 0.00 ms per processed frame; preparation took 19.67 ms, final GPU waiting 2.22 ms and Present 0.10 ms. That approximately 22 ms processing cycle accounts for 45 FPS without a 60 FPS sampler cap. Other intervals did deliver fewer captures and sometimes added idle time; this does not establish that capture cadence is always sufficient. Capture already runs on an independent producer thread, so its frame interval is not simply added to processing time for every frame.

The same session selected target 100 with 2x FG, deliberately limiting real processing to 50 FPS. Target 120 with 2x caps real processing at 60. The app does not change these saved settings automatically.

Changes:

- At native NR model resolution, FG reuses the full-resolution current-to-previous scene-motion guide already computed for NR, with the same scene-cut reset. This removes a second full-resolution estimator and its synchronous readback/submit. NR pixels and settings are unchanged. FG interpolation now uses the scene guide rather than re-estimating motion from the NR-modified picture. Lower/supersampled model resolutions, disabled NR motion and bypass modes retain the independent FG estimator; guide dimensions are checked, and switching resets the fallback estimator's history.
- The motion shader caches the current-image patch per thread group, rejects candidates whose accumulated nonnegative cost cannot beat the current best, and skips searches for perfect zero-displacement matches. Search radius, refinement, confidence and scene-cut thresholds are unchanged. All five existing motion fixtures produced identical vector fingerprints before/after, including a translated texture with zero median error and 97.1% of checked pixels within 2.5 pixels.
- Removed empty GPU submissions when draining already-completed captures during FPS limiting/pauses. The bounded capture queue already completes its own GPU copy before publication; selecting a frame queues no GPU wait. Actual processing/FG completion fences remain intact.
- Added separate preparation elapsed-time logs for Reflex, NR recording/motion and FG guides/encoding/copy. These CPU intervals explicitly include internal GPU waits, rather than being described as model-only times.

In a short 4K/two-pass/native-model headless comparison on the shared GPU, independent FG preparation measured 39.105 ms GPU span / 41.326 ms through completion; shared guides measured 35.656 / 39.517 ms. These fixtures include NR and preparation but exclude actual FG interpolation, capture and presentation. They are not a live FPS guarantee, and the currently running desktop/game workload affects absolute timings.

Passed: expanded NR + private SR + FG lifecycle check with native shared guides and 60/80-percent fallback guides, pause/resume/style/resolution switching, explicit assertion that shared guides add no submission/wait, D3D12 validation, capture-queue pinning/rotation/colour checks, pacing and fence wakeups. No game was launched and no live desktop was captured. Visible FG quality and live throughput remain for user verification.

## Private-DLSS edge correction and HDR output controls - 21 September 2026

The private upscaler reconstructs a bounded, signed NR residual. Small excursions outside its current source neighborhood can be amplified by residual decoding and, especially, by Hybrid/Neutwo replace's inverse curves near white. The standalone path now bounds DLSS excursions to the current 2x2 spatial footprint and uses the spatial reference where DLSS alone would cross the HDR inverse's white limit. The shared in-game shader, model settings and ordinary bilinear path are unchanged. One FP16 output-sized texture and one compute dispatch are added while private DLSS is active (about 63.3 MiB at 3840x2160).

--residual-check 1 passed with D3D12 validation. Deliberately injected ringing reproduced bright spikes: a Hybrid inverse-limit case rose from a source value of 5 to 176.25 linear units; correction retained 5. A separate eight-frame sequence through the real DLSS runtime produced 2,760,195 channel samples outside the fixture's carrier envelope, with peak carrier 0.901367; all corrected samples stayed within the source bounds. The extreme white-spike example is an injected regression fixture, not a reproduction of the user's captured scene. Neutral carriers and valid in-range samples were checked for exact identity.

The release application and checker built. --appearance-check 1 passed at 1280x720, 70% model resolution, two NR passes, estimated motion, private DLSS and Hybrid composed: exact bypass, DLSS/bilinear switching, colour and skin controls, reference-white invariance, moving frames and HDR highlight preservation. This also confirmed the edge correction does not make private DLSS identical to bilinear.

The new HDR output controls run in the existing label/output pass, after model composition and before FG conversion. Both default to zero. --feature-check 1 passed using synthetic HDR ramps/colours across all five mapping modes: 1000-nit peak ceiling, exact preservation below the shoulder, shadow lift/darken, unchanged reference white/highlights under black tuning, and an exact return to neutral pixels. Original comparison halves, swapped sides, bars/divider, disabled/zero-strength/hidden-edit bypass, debug views and SDR-display output remained unchanged. Settings persistence and the combined two-pass / estimated-motion / 70%-private-DLSS / Hybrid-replace path passed too.

The hidden FG swapchain check passed again: 119/178/237 reported presents from 60 real submissions at 2x/3x/4x, including an initial non-FG frame per mode. The NR/private-SR integration exercised shared and fallback motion guides, model resize, style rebuild, pause/resume and a bilinear switch. SDR/PQ numerical colour checks and D3D12 validation passed.

All checks were headless, using application-owned textures; no game was launched, live desktop captured or visible test window opened. Physical HDR brightness, perceived black levels, the user's white-pixel artifact and live performance remain for user verification.

## Stage timings and HWiNFO investigation - 21 September 2026

The old Throughput executable (SHA256 27F7846DDF68526D3653665039D99A0450A9FC1316B18F13B0A401FA9CFFD9B4) was observed running during the 10:47 slowdown. At 10:47:28 it processed 56.7 FPS from 121.4 acquired FPS; at 10:47:47 it processed 32.5 FPS from 32.5 acquired FPS. The corresponding processing/preparation plus completion-wait intervals were approximately 14.6 and 12.7 ms. Other samples on the HDR/edge build remained above 100 captured FPS but took around 25-30 ms in processing. These are two different limiting conditions; the logs do not establish one root cause for both.

HWiNFO had no running process, but its HWiNFO64 ETW session remained active with DXGI, DxgKrnl, DWM and other graphics providers enabled. The HWiNFO_215 driver also remained loaded. Windows recorded an HWiNFO nvml.dll access-violation crash at 08:45:37. The crash is a possible explanation for leftover instrumentation, not proof of when this session became orphaned or that it caused the user's current regression. The attempt to stop only HWiNFO64 tracing was rejected by Windows with Access denied; user administrator action is required. No GPU reset, game operation, driver unload or monitoring-configuration edit was performed.

The rebuilt app samples per-stage GPU timestamps every 32 frames, resolving/readback only across existing completion fences. The headless performance checker can also load an isolated or existing INI with --settings <path> (later command-line arguments override it). At 4K, 65% model resolution, two passes, private DLSS and estimated motion, the static synthetic fixture measured about 0.077 ms for edge correction and 0.067 ms for HDR/labels in the independent-FG preparation run. Its overall processing-through-completion mean was 11.865 ms. This excludes live capture, actual FG interpolation and physical presentation and does not reproduce moving gameplay. The orphaned trace was still active, so these are not before/after proof of its effect.

Release build and the 2x/3x/4x hidden FG integration check passed with per-stage timing enabled and D3D12 validation. The check exercised private DLSS, two NR passes, shared/fallback motion, resizing and pause/resume while requiring complete, finite timing readbacks. The timing change does not alter shader pixels, model parameters, capture pacing or FG synchronization. Live improvement is not claimed until the named trace is stopped and the same game scene is compared.

## Bounded production logging - 21 September 2026

Detailed CPU pipeline logging and GPU stage sampling are now opt-in through NR_CAPTURE_TIMINGS=1. With that environment variable absent, the application creates no GPU timing query/readback resources and writes routine performance summaries no more often than every 30 seconds. UI status and FPS updates remain unchanged. Startup, state transitions, errors and runtime messages still reach the bounded logger.

capture.log is capped at 2 MiB with one capture.log.1 backup capped at 2 MiB. Rotation retains the newest 2 MiB from an oversized legacy log. Oversized individual messages are bounded, and a failed backup write does not permit unlimited growth or raise an exception through the renderer.

The release build passed. The isolated --logging-check 1 passed exact boundary handling, one-backup replacement, oversized legacy logs/messages, newest-byte retention and failed-rotation behavior. Headless HDR/control/private-DLSS checks, the synthetic residual-edge check and the hidden 2x/3x/4x FG integration check passed with D3D12 validation. No game or visible test window was launched. Pixel shaders, HDR controls and the private-DLSS edge correction are unchanged in this logging update.

## Capture producer pacing - 2026-09-21

The live 3840x2160 log showed about 120 acquired/published frames per second for approximately 57 processed frames at a 116 FPS / 2x FG target. The capture producer previously ignored this processing limit and issued a full-resolution copy (plus SDR conversion when needed) for every acquired image. This is confirmed redundant work, not proof that it explains all source-FPS-dependent slowdown. The same logs also contain approximately 57 processed FPS with 120 FPS acquisition, so source acquisition rate alone is not a sufficient explanation for every slow interval.

Capture now uses the same fractional target/multiplier rate as NR. Its producer remains independent of processing. Dynamic target changes and stop wake its timer; zero remains uncapped. DXGI retains its previous frame during the wait and releases immediately before reacquiring, allowing Windows to accumulate changes instead of repeatedly copying intermediate desktop updates. WGC drains to the newest frame available at each acquisition; Windows' own WGC capture rate remains unchanged. No processing pixels, shader settings, GPU priorities, source-app settings or completion fences were changed.

Headless Release validation on the RTX 5090, with the D3D12 debug layer:
- Existing capture queue checks passed: exact HDR/SDR conversion, rotations, cropping, resizing, concurrent publication, newest-only selection and protection of the processing frame.
- The actual capture pacing helper plus GPU publication, driven by synthetic 120/240 FPS source timestamps, measured 56.9/57.0 copies per second at the fractional 116/2x cap. These are owned-texture scheduling checks, not live desktop throughput measurements.
- Capture target changes, uncapped mode and cancellation during a one-FPS wait passed.
- Existing 30/120/240 FPS timer checks, capture-event wake, stop cancellation and GPU completion wake passed. No 60 FPS ceiling was introduced.

WoW was not launched, controlled or captured for these checks. Live A/B testing at fixed filter settings with 60 versus 120 source FPS remains required. Even with the redundant copies removed, the source game, desktop compositor, NR and FG share GPU resources; reducing the game's internal rendering resolution does not reduce a 4K capture/output surface.
- Hidden FG regression check also passed: 180 real submissions, 534 SDK-reported presents across 2x/3x/4x, two NR passes with private DLSS, shared/fallback motion, resizing, pause/resume and SDR/PQ encoding. No test window was shown or activated.

## Classic composition with private DLSS - 2026-09-21

Private DLSS now supports both transfer modes below native resolution. Classic passes the bounded NR colour answer through SR and the existing Classic composition shader. Matched residuals retains its signed-edit carrier and inverse. The same SR feature, textures and local overshoot guard are reused; the Classic guard treats its input as colour and protects DLSS-only crossings of the HDR inverse's white limit. There are no new per-frame allocations or changes to the shared in-game shader. This adds a comparison route; it does not establish that all reported hair/skin halos are fixed.

The transfer selector remains available with DLSS, and loading settings no longer changes Classic to Matched. Switching the two DLSS inputs resets temporal history. The status identifies DLSS SR colour versus DLSS SR edit. The capture pacing performance fix and bounded, opt-in detailed logging remain intact.

Headless Release checks passed with the D3D12 debug layer:
- Classic+DLSS survives an isolated settings round trip.
- Real DLSS produces changed pixels, distinct from both Classic+bilinear and matched-residual DLSS; transfer/backend round trips restore the same reset-frame Classic output.
- Zero strength, hidden edit and native-size upscaler selection preserve their expected identity.
- Switching Classic/Matched/Classic resets history once per switch and then resumes temporal reuse.
- Two NR passes, estimated motion and all five HDR mappings produce finite output.
- Classic colour overshoot and HDR white-pole fixtures pass. Existing matched-residual fixtures still pass, including the real-DLSS edge sequence (2,760,195 raw out-of-envelope channel samples, all bounded after correction).
- Existing feature and HDR output-control checks pass.

No game was launched or controlled, and no desktop capture was used by these tests. Live appearance, temporal edge stability and gameplay performance remain for user verification.
- Hidden FG lifecycle check also passed with Classic DLSS frames in each 2x/3x/4x sequence: 180 real submissions and 534 SDK-reported presents, including motion, resizing, pause/resume and bilinear switching. No test window was shown or activated.

## Matched-residual halo correction - 2026-09-21

Added a spatial correction to the standalone private-DLSS matched-residual pass. Classic colour SR and bilinear transfer retain their previous paths. The existing NR input is bound as a colour guide in the unused t3 slot, with its extent in the correction pass's guide dimensions. The shared in-game shader, motion estimator, model settings, synchronization and capture pacing were not changed. No new render target, history buffer, DLSS evaluation or dispatch was added.

The correction measures full-resolution contrast within one low-resolution pixel, then compares the decoded DLSS edit with a 3x3 reference weighted by spatial distance and input-colour similarity. A local mean plus two standard deviations, a small absolute allowance and 20% contrast allowance define supported brightening. Only excess positive luminance near strong edges with a reliable matching guide is blended toward the reference. Returning the original carrier outside the mask preserves those values exactly. The existing range and HDR inverse-pole guards remain in place.

The initial 10% contrast allowance slightly reduced a legitimate bright-strand fixture with modest reconstruction contrast. Raising the allowance to 20% preserved that fixture while retaining strong suppression of cross-edge leakage.

Release/headless validation on RTX 5090:
- D3D12 debug-layer edge fixtures passed for SDR and all five HDR mappings. A misplaced +0.06994 edit on a dark pixel beside a light surface was reduced to +0.01400 (supported local edit +0.01), while the bright side remained bit-identical. This is injected, controlled leakage; it is not a measured WoW artifact.
- Flat-area detail, supported bright strands, negative edits, a thin feature without a reliable guide, and Classic colour SR preserved their tested pixels.
- Existing residual range, white-pole, neutral identity and real-DLSS edge-sequence checks passed. The latter still bounded all 2,760,195 raw out-of-envelope channel samples in its flat-guide fixture.
- Full feature checks passed, including Classic/matched switching, native and bypass identity, two-pass temporal processing, supersampling, comparison and HDR output controls.
- At 3840x2160, 65% model scale, two passes, estimated motion and private DLSS, the static synthetic performance check measured correction means of 0.164 / 0.222 / 0.167 / 0.167 ms across its four modes. Before this change they were 0.082 / 0.182 / 0.082 / 0.114 ms. Scheduling outliers occurred; these are short headless measurements, not gameplay FPS or physical presentation latency. Whole-frame timings varied with system load and must not be used to claim a speedup.

Build completed with existing compiler warnings. An offline shader compile with the new correction disabled also reproduced the FXC BoundPrivateUpscale and glyph analysis warnings; GPU pixel and debug-layer checks passed.

The game was not launched or controlled, and live desktop capture was not used. The user must verify hair/skin halos, fine bright detail and temporal stability on actual content. This first conservative correction deliberately leaves ambiguous cases alone.
- Hidden FG lifecycle check passed on the final build: 2x/3x/4x, 180 real submissions and 534 SDK-reported presents, with two NR passes, private DLSS, Classic/matched switching, shared/fallback motion, resize and pause/resume. The fixture window was never shown or activated.

## Matched lighting correction for both upscalers - 2026-09-21

The user reported that the preceding private-DLSS residual heuristic did not remove the hair/skin halos, and that the issue also occurs with bilinear matched transfer. That heuristic and its extra guide binding have been removed. The basic private-DLSS range and HDR inverse-pole guards remain.

The standalone output pass now checks final lighting gain at skin-coloured edges after composition and the skin/environment controls, before HDR tuning and labels. Both subnative matched upscalers use this pass. It compares processed/original luminance with similar original colours farther into the bright side. This also detects insufficient darkening, which the previous positive-residual-only test excluded. The correction preserves hue, uses no temporal state and does not reduce the skin slider globally. Classic, native resolution, bypass, debug views and comparison originals are excluded. No shared game shader, model parameters, motion estimator, frame pacing or frame-generation lifecycle code changed.

A simple additive transfer can produce this failure without DLSS: for full-resolution F, low-resolution L, model M=gL and upsampling U, F+U(M-L) differs from gF by (1-g)*(F-U(L)). A negative edit can therefore leave the bright side of a sharp edge relatively too bright. This is a plausible mechanism established by the transfer arithmetic, not a measured identification of the user's WoW pixels. The final-lighting check also covers HDR replace output without assuming its transfer arithmetic is identical.

Release validation:
- Controlled final-image fixtures passed with the D3D12 debug layer at 99%, 65% and 25% scales. For an entirely negative edit, a skin-side red value of 0.4951 was reduced to 0.3958 versus a supported interior value of 0.3850. For a positive edit, 0.7700 was reduced to 0.6787 versus 0.6600. These are synthetic rims, not game measurements.
- Uniform darkening, neutral lighting, uniform brightening, the tested genuine original highlight, non-skin colours, disabled correction, original comparison regions, dividers and letterboxing remained unchanged. In these tests changes were confined to the injected rim; results stayed finite and did not brighten pixels.
- Existing residual/Classic overshoot, inverse-pole and real-DLSS sequence checks passed. Full feature/HDR checks passed, including both transfer modes and backend switching, bypass/native identity, two-pass motion and history reset/resume.
- Hidden FG lifecycle check passed: 2x/3x/4x, 180 real submissions and 534 SDK-reported presents, resize, pause/resume and bilinear switching. The test window was never shown or activated.
- The first 4K synthetic benchmark (65% model, two passes, motion and private DLSS) completed. The output stage including the new guard measured about 0.069 ms mean in that fixture; it does not exercise a screen full of skin edges and is not a worst-case cost or gameplay measurement.
- A subsequent benchmark-fixture creation script failed before producing its intended skin/edge content. During that attempt Windows recorded an NVIDIA TDR at 14:46:41-43. The new test process failed while creating its NR root signature with DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED (0x887A0005), before processing an image or dispatching the correction. The running older Display Filter also reported shutdown around this reset. Its cause has not been isolated; further GPU tests were stopped. The skin-heavy benchmark and reset-free concurrent-runtime operation are NOT validated.

No live desktop/game image was captured and no game was launched or controlled. The new build was not launched. The user still needs to check the actual hair/skin boundary. Colour selection is approximate: uncertain edges can retain halos and real model-generated edge lighting can be reduced. This replaces the failed heuristic; it is not a claim that the live artifact has been proven fixed.

## Correct subnative lighting reconstruction - 2026-09-21

The user confirmed that the 99% raw model output is clean while final composition has halos, and that 100% and 101% do not have the artifact. The input downsampler and NR evaluation have therefore been left unchanged. The unsuccessful post-composition skin-edge heuristic and its bindings were removed.

Below native resolution the standalone pipeline now prepares a bounded relative-lighting/chromaticity field from the model output and its matching input. Lighting is (modelY-inputY)/inputY; chromaticity is R/Y and B/Y. Classic carries model chromaticity; Matched carries its difference from the input, preserving native colour detail. Bilinear decodes the carrier before interpolation. Private DLSS uses the same field and existing local carrier bounds. The enlarged field reconstructs a native-size model image; the shared resolve then sees model and reference at the same resolution and applies the existing tone mapping, strength, colour and skin controls once. Lighting is kept separate from chroma/gamut fitting, preventing a colour boundary from changing the requested luminance gain.

Near-black input samples infer gain from paired neighbours rather than interpolating an undefined gain into a visible edge. Completely black native pixels remain black. This is a deliberate limitation of multiplicative lighting transfer: model-generated light in a truly zero-valued source pixel is suppressed below native resolution. New colour/gamut limits may also change subnative colour near extreme gamut boundaries. Actual content still needs visual assessment.

The code is isolated to standalone/NrCapture. ModelResize.hlsli contains the reconstruction. The shared OptiScaler shader, model parameters, motion, capture pacing, FG implementation, game installations and upstream PRs were not changed. The 100% path and supersampling above 100% retain their prior processing. The new textures are allocated on resize and reused: compared with the preceding build, private DLSS adds one full-size RGBA16F intermediate; bilinear adds that and one model-size carrier (about 63 MiB and 90 MiB respectively at 4K/65%). Existing fences cover their use/release.

Release checks on the RTX 5090 with the D3D12 debug layer:
- 324 compiled-shader fixtures passed: 99/65/25%, Classic/Matched, SDR/five HDR modes, spatial/full-size carrier paths, uniform darkening/brightening, neutral identity, cool-dark/warm-skin boundaries, zero colour channels and black boundaries. Full-size carrier fixtures inject reconstruction overshoot; they do not claim to emulate every DLSS behavior.
- The old 99% soft-knee composition produced a bright-edge error of 0.066895 against a roughly 0.385 native reference (about 17%). The corrected maximum relative RGB error over the applicable native-reference comparisons was 0.3446%. Classic intentionally retains resized chroma at coloured boundaries, where its luminance was checked instead of requiring identical RGB. Neutral Matched reconstruction preserved the encoded full-size proxy exactly.
- Both HDR inverse-pole fallback fixtures passed.
- Real DLSS edge sequence passed: all 2,760,195 raw out-of-envelope channel samples were bounded after correction.
- Full feature/HDR checks passed, including held frame, independent passes, supersampling filters, debug/comparison views, exact bypass/native identity, transfer/backend switching and two-pass temporal processing. Real NR/DLSS checks at exactly 99/100/101% passed; DLSS selection was bit-identical to spatial selection at/above native, where SR is bypassed.
- Hidden FG lifecycle passed: 2x/3x/4x, 180 real submissions and 534 SDK-reported presents, two NR passes, resize, style changes, motion, pause/resume and bilinear switching. No fixture window was shown or activated.
- A static 4K/65%/two-pass/motion/private-DLSS/soft-knee benchmark completed. NR-only processing through GPU completion averaged 9.704 ms; with the FPS label and shared/fallback FG preparation it was about 10 ms. These exclude capture, interpolation and physical presentation and are not gameplay FPS. The total GPU span includes the new reconstruction dispatches, which do not yet have separate stage counters.

An attempted software-only run failed in Windows d3d10warp.dll while executing the pre-existing encode shader, before reconstruction. The temporary WARP adapter option was removed. Final shader checks run without loading NGX; runtime/FG checks were then run sequentially after the user closed Display Filter. No new NVIDIA driver-reset event was found during these final checks.

No live desktop/game image was captured, no game was launched or controlled, and the packaged app was not launched. The remaining check is the user's actual hair/skin boundary and temporal image quality.
